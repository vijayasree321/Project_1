        <p>Dal Makhani is that quintessential Punjabi dish that you really can’t get enough of, ever. Once your palate gets a taste of it, its going to keep longing for more and more.
            And why not? When whole black lentils and kidney beans are cooked in a spiced onion-tomato base, with generous amounts of butter and cream; the dish is bound to be decadent.
            Yes, it is calorie-laden too. But then, there’s no harm in consuming such bingeworthy food once in a while. We all have our cheat days, and I’m quite sure that this luscious, smooth, and creamy Dal Makhani Recipe is a perfect fit for such days.
            Also, after eating a meal of this rich dal, do not forget to burn those extra calories by exercising a bit more or running for a longer time!</p>
